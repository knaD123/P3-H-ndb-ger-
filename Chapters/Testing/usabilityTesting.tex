\section{Usability Testing}
% Har svært ved hvornår jeg skal bruge usability testing eller usability test. Så det retter I bare til 

To gain a better understanding and detecting what issues could possibly arise when Ipsen interacts with the application, usability tests were conducted during the project. 
Usability testing results in possible usability issues which are guidelines to further improve the system's design. 

\subsection{Usability test setup and structure}
Before usability testing is conducted it is important to find out the purpose and objectives of the test. 
A task list will be defined based on the objectives of the usability test that the test subject need to complete using the application. The observations of the test consists of a test monitor, a screen video recording including audio and a video recording of the view of the PC screen and the test subject's interaction with the keyboard and the mouse. 
During the usability testing the test subject was asked to think aloud while performing a task to easily identify and categorize possible issues in \textit{critical}, \textit{serious} and \textit{cosmetic} which are described below \citep[p.~154]{brugervenligtwebdesign}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Critical: An issue is classified as critical if the test subject are unable to continue and stopped completing tasks.
Critical issues can also involving high irritation while interacting with the application or if the test subject misunderstood one or more significant points of the application.
  \item Serious: If the test subject is significantly slowed down to completing tasks. 
This means the test subject has to use several minutes on a task.
	\item Cosmetic: When the test subject spends few minutes to completing a task and the issue is still should be solved. 
\end{itemize}

After a usability testing is conducted a debriefing session immediately  begins. 
Under debriefing session post-test questions will be asked for gain a deeper understanding of test subject's experience with the application overall. 
Here test subject is able to mention criticism of the interaction design and suggests solutions and design ideas. 
Besides a debriefing session's time frame should also allow for discussion if needed. 

Evaluation of the test will proceed as follows; while performing the usability testing the test monitor is taking notes of the possible issues and difficulties that test subject seems to encountered during interacting with the application. 
To better identify and categorize issues a screen recording with audio is reviewed and to ensure there is no missing observations.

\subsection{First usability test}
This section will describe the first usability test which was conducted on Ipsen and its results.

\subsubsection{Purpose and objectives of the test}
The majority requested functionalities for administrator role was implemented in the application at this point. 
Therefore the first usability test will only tested the administrator role part of the application.
The interaction between the test subject and the application must be validated to determine usefulness of the implemented functionalities. 
The purpose of the test is to identify general issues concerning the perception of the handbook application for further improvements of the application design.
The research questions, the method description and the task list can be found in \Cref{bilag:utestbilag}.

\subsubsection{Results}
The identified issues discovered during the usability test will be presented and categorized below in \Cref{tab:utest1} with explainations following. 

\begin{table}[H]

	\begin{tabular}{| c | m{21em} | c | c | c | c | c |}

	\caption{Identified issues for the first usability test}\label{tab:utest1}
\end{table}

The identified issue '1' occurred when Ipsen tried to create a new document and add a version to the document. 
As Ipsen thought that it is possible to both add a document and upload at the same time. 
The application at the current state would work such that user need to add a document first by enter the document name, chapter ID and section ID. 

Afterwards the user needed to find the document in the handbook and upload a new version. 
This created confusion which cause an interrupted work flow with the handbook.

The identified issue '2' took place when Ipsen attempted to create a new document. 
Ipsen needed to go back to the handbook's overview to check the existing document ID to be able find out which chapter the new document should belong to. 

The identified issue '3' occurred when Ipsen tried to create a new version to an existing document. 
It was unclear where to upload a new version. 
Therefore Ipsen tried to add a new document and then uploaded a new version. 
The upload button was not noticeable and took time before Ipsen found it. 

The identified issue '4' turned up as Ipsen tried to send a version to approval and then  approve the version herself.
Ipsen did not detect when she had sent the version to approval or whether she just approved the version. 
An indication or a message displayed to the user after a version is sent to approval or that the version is now approved and now are available in the handbook should solve this issue.

As identified issue '5' point out the confusion that occurred while Ipsen attempted to approve a version could be that the sidebar did not indicate which page she was currently on. 

The identified issues '6' and '7' appeared when Ipsen made a mistake as the application allowed her to enter a negative chapter and section ID. 
Ipsen felt the need to correct the mistake which the application did not support at the moment.
Ipsen wished to be able to delete a document that do not contain a version yet if a mistake occur.

The identified issue '8' occurred as Ipsen assigned a user to a department and noticed that users was presented as email address.
Ipsen preferred name instead of email address.

In the debriefing session Ipsen mentioned that she was surprised that the application required user to attached a pdf file as she has seen other document version control system has their own file editor.
However, Ipsen could see the reason behind it and commented that it is a good approach.
%Anna: Evt. kommenter at hun i virkeligheden selv havde sagt dette ikke skulle være en del af systemet til at starte med (evt henvis til iteration 1)

Ipsen also remarked that the features' names were clear and understandable. 

%%% Andre kommentarer %%%
%Afdelingsleder holder styr på hvem der har læst hvad
%Kom frem til at admin skal kunne bruge sin admin ret til at få det godkendt hvis andre som blev sat til approvals ikke få det gjort (Kunne måske være relevant at kommenterer da det var noget vi tog til efterretning til næste test ) 
%Det virker ulogisk for pia i starten at den gældende version også i arkiver og ikke kun under handbook. Men synes til sidst at det smart når man skal audit og så det er nemt at finde frem (Anna: Tror jeg i stedet tager denne ned i iterationsafsnittet i stedet for hvis det er ok )

%en version er kun uploadet -- kan man slet den 
%en version som er blevet godkendt -- arkveret 

%Admin har en overrolloing hvis folk ikke går ind og godkender. Hvis folk tager for lang tid om det eller hvis folk er på ferie. (Anna: Samme kommentar som du har i starten af de her kommentarer )


\subsection{Second usability test}
The second usability test was conducted on Ipsen, Ipsen's husband and their daughter. 
The reader, writer and administrator roll were all been tested in the application.

\subsubsection{Purpose and objectives of the test}
The usability issues from the first test has been corrected and ready to be tested to determine whether the new functionalities are improved or not. 
All the rolls need to be tested as well as the recently added functionality which are required by the system definition. 
The department and user management in the application will also be a part of the testing. The task list for the second usability test can be found in \Cref{bilag:utestbilag}.

\subsubsection{Results}

The detected usability issues are present and categorize in table 
\Cref{tab:utest2} which will be clarify afterwards.
