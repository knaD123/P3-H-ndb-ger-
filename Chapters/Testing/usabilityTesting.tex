\section{Usability Testing}

To gain a better understanding and detecting what issues could possibly arise when Ipsen interacts with the system, usability tests were conducted during the project. 
Usability testing results in possible usability issues which are guidelines to further improve the system's design. 

\subsection{Usability testing setup? and structure}
Before usability testing is conducted it is important to find out the purpose and objectives of the test. A task list will be defined based on the objectives of the usability test that the test subject need to complete using the system. The observations of the test consists of a test monitor, a screen video recording including audio and a video recording of the view of the PC screen and the test subject's interaction with the keyboard and the mouse. During the usability testing the test subject was asked to think aloud while performing a task to easily identify and categorize possible issues in \textit{critical}, \textit{serious} and \textit{cosmetic} which are described below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Critical: An issue is classified as 
  \item Serious:
  \item Cosmetic: 
\end{itemize}

% results in the First usability testing:
	% Det så ud som om, at Pia ikke forstod, at når der blev oprettet et nyt dokument, så forestillede hun sig, at der allerede var et nyt dokument. 

	%Forslag: Gør det tydeligt, at brugeren selv skal uploade et nyt dokument, eller gør det muligt at uploade ny version samtidigt med at man opretter nyt dokument
