\section{Bugs}
% Hvad er en bug
There exists a lot of terms to describe that a program is not behaiving as intended or crashes, like; \textit{Fault, failure} and \textit{incident}.
A reason for all these different terms is that e.g. incident might not sound negative enough to be used for very severe or dangerous errors. \cite{SoftwareTesting}

The term \textit{bug} will be used throughout this chapter to avoid any confusions or even misunderstandings.
A bug occurs when one of these five rules is true: \cite{SoftwareTesting} % Denne s√¶tning skal muligvis omformuleres

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{''The software doesn't do something that the product specification says it should do.''}
	\item \textit{''The software does something that the product specification says it shouldn't do.'''}
	\item \textit{''The software does something that the specification doesn't mention.''}
	\item \textit{''The software doesn't do something that the product specification doesn't mention but should.''}
	\item \textit{''The software is difficult to understand, hard to use, slow, or - in the software tester's eyes - will be viewed by the end user as just plain not right.''}
\end{enumerate}
