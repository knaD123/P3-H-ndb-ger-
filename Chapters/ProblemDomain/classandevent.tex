%\todo[inline]{Henrik: Fjern reactivate document}
This chapter covers the problem domain analysis based on data gathered in the initial interviews with Ipsen.
The following sections include the selection of selected classes and events, a rundown of the structure between classes, and the description of the behavior patterns through statechart diagrams.

\section{Classes and events}\label{sec:ClassEvent}
The following subsections explore the potential class and event candidates as well as the thought process behind them.
The generated class and event candidates will be systematically selected based upon their relevance and whether they satisfy the system definition.
The process of systematically selecting classes and events is from the Object Oriented Design \& Analysis (OOA\&D) method, \cite{Rod-Aalborg}.

\subsection{Classes} \label{sec:Classes}
According to  \citep[p.~55]{Rod-Aalborg} a class is defined as seen below.
\begin{defn}\label{defn:class}
	A description of a collection of objects sharing structure, behavioral pattern, and attributes.
\end{defn}

The questions below help to evaluate a class. The more affirmative the answers are the more likely it is that a class is the correct representation. \citep[p.~62]{Rod-Aalborg}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can you identify objects from the class?
	\item Does the class contain unique information?
	\item Does the class encompass multiple objects?
	\item Does the class have a suitable and manageable number of events?
\end{itemize}

In the following the classes from \cref{tab:ClassCandidates} are through a systematic selection deemed qualified or not qualified based on the criteria mentioned above.

\begin{table} [H]
\begin{tabular}{l l}
	\hline
	Classes & Comment\\
	\hline
	\texttt{Company} & The companies that need to be managed \\
	\texttt{Handbook} & The newest version of all the documents\\
	\texttt{Document} & The documents in the handbook\\
	\texttt{User }& Users with either reader, writer or administrator role\\
	\texttt{Version} & Documentâ€™s version and the validity period\\
	\texttt{Log} & Descriptions of changes for each version\\
	\texttt{Responsibility} & Difference user access levels to the handbook\\
	\texttt{Approval} & Keeps track of who has to approve specific
	versions\\
	\textbf{TOC} & The table of contents of the documents in the handbook\\
	\textbf{Notification} & Sends notice to relevant users when a new version is submitted\\
	\textbf{Read Status} & Keeps track of who has read which document and version\\
	\textbf{Supplier} & Supplier who has to be approved \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Class candidates}\label{tab:ClassCandidates}
\end{table}

\textbf{Qualified classes}

The \texttt{Company} keeps track of companies that use the system, which is an important concept to keep track of.

The \texttt{Handbook} keeps track of the documents and is an important part of the problem domain and system definition.

The \texttt{Document} works as an item for the various versions in an item-descriptor pattern.

The \texttt{Version} encapsulates the version data in the documents, and allows the document to have multiple instances of them.

The \texttt{User} is qualified because there would be different types of users with different access levels in the system.

The \texttt{Approval} is vital to substantiate who has to or already has approved each version and at what date it was approved.

The \texttt{Read Status} is qualified since there is a need to keep track of which users has read what versions and when.
This is useful when the company has to report a total number of employees that have read the current version of the document.

The \texttt{Supplier} is qualified seeing that the administrator needs to keep a record of all documents related to approval of suppliers.

\textbf{Not qualified classes}

The changelog simply consists of a text string from version to version.
Because of this, making it an actual object would be overcomplicating the model, and it has therefore been preserved as an attribute of the \texttt{Version} class.

The \texttt{Responsibility} is not qualified because the different levels of access and permissions are present in the \texttt{User} class.

The \texttt{TOC} is a property of the \texttt{Handbook} class and does not contain unique information.
The purpose with \texttt{TOC} is to create an overview of the valid documents in the handbook.

The \texttt{Notification} is more an event rather than a class.
The functionality in the \texttt{Notification} class is to assign users to specific documents therefore the name is modified to \texttt{Department} instead.

Hereby, the Qualified classes are as follows:
\begin{multicols}{4}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Company}
	\item \textit{Handbook}
	\item \textit{Document}
	\item \textit{Version}
	\item \textit{User}
	\item \textit{Approval}
	\item \textit{Department}
	\item \textit{Read Status}
	\item \textit{Supplier}
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Events} \label{sec:Events}
According to \citep[p.~53]{Rod-Aalborg} is an event defined as,
\begin{defn}\label{defn:Event}
An instantaneous incident involving one or more objects.
\end{defn}
Once again the questions below help to evaluate an event if those are affirmative \citep[p.~65]{Rod-Aalborg}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is the event instantaneous?
	\item Is the event atomic?
	\item Can the event be identified when it happens?
\end{itemize}

The event being instantaneous refers to there not being any timeframe which can be described as "while the event is happening". There is only a before and after.

The event being atomic means that the event is indivisible. It cannot be divided into smaller events.

The event being identifiable refers to it being obvious when it happens. The system will be able to know of the event happening, either due to the event happening within the system, or because it is informed of the event happening by an user.

In the rest of the section the generated events in \cref{tab:EventCandidates} will be reviewed and deemed either qualified or not qualified regarding the systematical selection based on the criteria written above.

\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{tabular}{m{4,3 cm} l}
		\hline
		Event & Comment\\
		\hline
		\textbf{Document added} & A document is created.\\
		\textbf{Document archived} & A document where version is archived instead of updated.\\
		%\textbf{Document reactivated} & Archived document is to be accessible in the handbook again\\
		\textbf{Document deleted} & Wrong document is created, and is still without version\\
		\textbf{Version approved}  & When approved it becomes available in the handbook\\
		\textbf{New version released} &  New version becomes available in the handbook\\
		\textbf{Version archived} & When newer approved version is added to handbook\\
		\textbf{Version marked \newline as read} & User has verified that the newest version has been read\\
		\textbf{User added} & An administrator created a user\\
		\textbf{User updated} & An administrator or user updated the user's information\\
		\textbf{User deactivated} & An administrator removed a user's access for the handbook\\
		\textbf{User reactivated} & Deactivated user is granted access to the handbook again\\
		\textbf{User deleted} & User deleted by an administrator\\

		\textbf{Department added} & Department is created\\
		\textbf{Department deleted} & Department is removed from system\\
		\textbf{Department's users\newline updated} & Associating  a user to or removing form a department\\
		\textbf{Department's\newline documents updated} & Associating a document to or removing from a department.\\

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Event Candidates}\label{tab:EventCandidates}
\end{table}

\textbf{Qualified events}

\textit{Document added} event is qualified reasoned that a document object must be created first before it has a version object added.

\textit{Document archived} event is qualified because it is an important functionality to archive expired documents for number of years according to ISO 9001 document management requirements.

%\textit{Document reactivated} event is qualified since it must also be able to reactivate the document and make it available in the handbook again.

\textit{Document deleted} is qualified for the reason that if an administrator made a mistake and added a wrong document then the delete option should be available.

\textit{Version approved} event are qualified since it is important for the system to register and keep track of when a version is complete within the approval process and whether it should be accessible in the handbook.

\textit{Version marked as read} event is qualified because it is crucial for the company to register if employees had read specific documents and versions and are up to date with the current standards.

\textit{Version archived} event is qualified for the same reason as \textit{document archived} event.

\textit{User added}, \textit{user updated} and \textit{user deleted} events are all qualified as an administrator need to manage company's user list.

\textit{Supplier added}, \textit{supplier updated},  \textit{supplier deleted} and \textit{supplier approved} events are all qualified since suppliers need to be manage by an administrator whether they are approved or when to be reapproved.

\textit{Approval requested} event are qualified seeing that it is important part of the system definition that the system must support an approval process.

\textit{Department added} and \textit{department deleted} events are qualified seeing that it is important for the administrator to keep track of company's current departments.

\textit{Department's documents updated} and \textit{department's users updated} events are qualified since it is vital to associate a user to a specific department and to associate documents to the relevant departments.

\textit{Department notified user} event is qualified seeing that the system must be able to send notifications to the correct user from a specific department that a associated document has released a new version.

\textbf{Not qualified events}

\textit{New version released} event is not qualified seeing that it is a duplicate of the \textit{version approved} event.

The reason for the \textit{User deactivated} event was so that the system would always be able to report who has read a specific version, as is the requirements to such a management system. The principle was that a deactivated user object would only contain user's name while the rest information is erased. Instead this will be the effect of the \textit{user deleted} event and thus \textit{user deactivated} is obsolete.

\textit{User reactivated} event is not qualified, since a user cannot be deactivated but is instead deleted. In the rare occasion a company wishes to reemploy a person they have to create a new user in the system again for this person.

\textit{Approval denied (Version)} event is not qualified as Ipsen does not desire this functionality since approver himself will contact Ipsen directly and afterwards a new approval request is made and the previous approval request will be deleted. \textit{Approval deleted (Version)} event is therefore qualified.

\textit{Approval confirmed} event is not qualified since its purpose is the same as \textit{version approved} event.

\textit{Document printed} event is not qualified since the problem domain does not include controlling of printed documents.

Qualified events:

	\item Document added
	\item Document archived

\end{multicols}

\section{Event table}\label{sec:EventTable}
The result of the selected qualified events and classes from \cref{sec:Classes,sec:Events} is an event table representing their relations, see \cref{fig:eventtable}.
The symbols used in the table is to be understood such that; $+$ is an event that can occur zero or one time, and $\star$ is an event which can occur zero or multiple times.

\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}

	\caption{Event table}\label{fig:eventtable}
\end{table}

Looking at the event table above it can be seen that \textit{document added} and \textit{document deleted} both can occur zero or multiple times for \textit{Handbook} and zero or one time for \textit{Document}.
This is because during the lifetime of a \textit{Handbook} it is possible to add and delete documents to it as many times its desired, but a single \textit{Document} can only be added or deleted once.
Keep in mind, that it is not possible to trigger the \textit{document deleted} event if the \textit{Handbook} does not contain any documents.
A less trivial event from the event table could be the \textit{approval requested} event.
Here it can be seen that this event occurs zero or one time for a \textit{Version} and an \textit{Approval}, but it can occur zero or multiple times for \textit{User} because multiple users can be assigned to approve a new version.

This event table is useful in the designing of the system, as it displays all the events that the system needs to keep track of, and what objects should be included in each event. It will influence the actual implementation later in the process.
