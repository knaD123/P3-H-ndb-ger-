This chapter covers the problem domain analysis based on data gathered in the initial interviews with Ipsen.
%, see \cref{sec:firstinterview}.
The following sections include the selection of selected classes and events, a rundown of the structure between classes, and the description of the behavior patterns through statechart diagrams.

\section{Classes and events}
The following subsections explore the potential class and event candidates as well as the thought process behind them.
The generated class and event candidates will be systematically selected based upon their relevance and whether they satisfy the system definition.
The process of systematically selecting classes and events is from the Object Oriented Design \& Analysis (OOA\&D) method \cite{Rod-Aalborg}.
\todo[inline]{Rasmus: Tjek om der er refereret til OOAD længere oppe}

\subsection{Classes} \label{sec:Classes}
According to  \citep[p.~55]{Rod-Aalborg} a class is defined as seen below.
\begin{defn}\label{defn:class}
	A description of a collection of objects sharing structure, behavioral pattern, and attributes.
\end{defn}

The questions below help to evaluate a class. The more affirmative the answers are the more likely it is that a class is the correct representation. \citep[p.~62]{Rod-Aalborg}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can you identify objects from the class?
	\item Does the class contain unique information?
	\item Does the class encompass multiple objects?
	\item Does the class have a suitable and manageable number of events?
\end{itemize}

In the following the classes from \cref{tab:ClassCandidates} are through a systematic selection deemed qualified or not qualified based on the criteria mentioned above.

\begin{table} [H]
\begin{tabular}{l l}
	\hline
	Classes & Comment\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Company} & The companies managed by the system \\
	\textbf{Handbook} & The newest version of all the documents\\
	\textbf{Document} & The documents in the handbook\\
	\textbf{User }& Users with either reader, writer or administrator role\\
	\textbf{Version} & Document’s version and the validity period\\
	\textbf{Log} & Descriptions of changes for each version\\
	\textbf{Responsibility} & Difference user access levels to the handbook\\
	\textbf{Approval} & Keeps track of who has to approve specific
	versions\\
	\textbf{TOC} & The table of contents of the documents in the handbook\\
	\textbf{Notification} & Sends notice to relevant users when a new version is submitted\\
	\textbf{Read Status} & Keeps track of who has read which document and version\\
	\textbf{Supplier} & Supplier who has to be approved \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Class candidates}\label{tab:ClassCandidates}
\end{table}

\todo[inline]{Anja, fix det der qualified så du kan være tilfreds. like omg}
The \textit{Company} class is qualified since it keeps track of companies that use the system, which is an important concept to keep track of.

The \textit{Handbook} class is qualified for the reason that it keeps track of the documents and is an important part of the problem domain and system definition.

The \textit{Document} class is qualified because it works as an item for the various versions in an item-descriptor pattern.

The \textit{Version} class is qualified since it encapsulates the version data in the documents, and allows the document to have multiple instances of them.

The \textit{User} class is qualified because there would be different types of users with different access levels in the system.

The \textit{Log} class is not qualified because the class does not contain unique information and the class it self is too simple.
It is unnecessary to create an independent class for the changelog and therefore it has been converted to an attribute for the \textit{Version} class.

The \textit{Responsibility} class is not qualified because the different levels of access and permissions are present in the \textit{User} class.

The \textit{Approval} class is qualified since it is vital to substantiate who is has to or already has approved each version and at what date it was approved.

The \textit{TOC} class is not qualified since \textit{TOC} is a property of the \textit{Handbook} class and does not contain unique information.
The purpose with \textit{TOC} is to create an overview of the valid documents in the handbook.

The \textit{Notification} class is not qualified as the notification is more an event rather than a class.
The functionality in the \textit{Notification} class is to assign users to specific documents therefore the name is modified to \textit{Department} instead.

The \textit{Read Status} class is qualified since the system needs to store information regarding which users has read what versions and when.
%Anna: Skal Read status også holde styr på hvornår de har læst det?
This is useful when the company has to report a total number of employees that have read the current version of the document.

The \textit{Supplier} class is qualified seeing that the administrator needs to keep a record of all documents related to approval of suppliers.

Hereby, the Qualified classes are as follows:
\begin{multicols}{4}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Company}
	\item \textit{Handbook}
	\item \textit{Document}
	\item \textit{Version}
	\item \textit{User}
	\item \textit{Approval}
	\item \textit{Department}
	\item \textit{Read Status}
	\item \textit{Supplier}
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Events} \label{sec:Events}
According to \citep[p.~53]{Rod-Aalborg} is an event defined as,
\begin{defn}\label{defn:Event}
An instantaneous incident involving one or more objects.
\end{defn}
Once again the questions below help to evaluate an event if those are affirmative \citep[p.~65]{Rod-Aalborg}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is the event instantaneous?
	\item Is the event atomic?
	\item Can the event be identified when it happens?
\end{itemize}
\todo[inline]{RASMUS: Forklar hvad de her ting betyder. Tænker et par siders teori om atomets historie eller noget, idk}

In the rest of the section the generated events in \cref{tab:EventCandidates} will be reviewed and deemed either qualified or not qualified regarding the systematical selection based on the criteria written above.

\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{tabular}{m{4,3 cm} l}
		\hline
		Event & Comment\\
		\hline
		\textbf{Document added} & A document is created.\\
		\textbf{Document archived} & A document where version is archived instead of updated.\\
		\textbf{Document reactivated} & Archived document is to be accessible in the handbook again\\
		\textbf{Document deleted} & Wrong document is created, and is still without version\\
		\textbf{Version approved}  & When approved it becomes available in the handbook\\
		\textbf{New version released} &  New version becomes available in the handbook\\
		\textbf{Version archived} & When newer approved version is added to handbook\\
		\textbf{Version marked \newline as read} & User has verified that the newest version has been read\\
		\textbf{User added} & An administrator created a user\\
		\textbf{User updated} & An administrator or user updated the user's information\\
		\textbf{User deactivated} & An administrator removed a user's access for the handbook\\
		\textbf{User reactivated} & Deactivated user is granted access to the handbook again\\
		\textbf{User deleted} & User deleted from the system by an administrator\\
		\textbf{Supplier added} & New supplier has been registered\\
		\textbf{Supplier updated} & Supplier's information has been updated\\
		\textbf{Supplier deleted} & Supplier has been removed from the system\\
		\textbf{Supplier approved} & Supplier's document has been approved\\
		\textbf{Approval requested} & New version is created and the approval requested is sent\\
		\textbf{Approval confirmed}
		& Approval is confirmed by one approver\\
		\textbf{Approval denied}
		& Approval is rejected by every approver\\
		\textbf{Department added} & Department is created\\
		\textbf{Department deleted} & Department is removed from system\\
		\textbf{Department's users\newline updated} & Associating  a user to or removing form a department\\
		\textbf{Department's\newline documents updated} & Associating a document to or removing from a department.\\

\end{table}

\todo[inline]{Rasmus: Der mangler igen forklarende tekst om, hvad der gør eventsene qualified eller ikke qualified. i know}

\textit{Document added} event is qualified reasoned that a document object must be created first before it has a version object added.

\textit{Document archived} event is qualified because it is an important functionality to archive expired documents for number of years according to ISO 9001 document management requirements.

\textit{Document reactivated} event is qualified since if the system can archive a document, it must also be able to reactivated and make it available in the handbook again.

\textit{Document deleted} is qualified for the reason that if an administrator made a mistake and added a wrong document then the delete option should be available.

\textit{Version approved} event are qualified since it is important for the system to register and keep track of when a version is complete within the approval process and whether it should be accessible in the handbook.

\textit{New version released} event is not qualified seeing that it is a duplicate of the \textit{version approved} event.

\textit{Version marked as read} event is qualified because it is crucial for the company to register if employees had read specific documents and versions and are up to date with the current standards.

\textit{Version archived} event is qualified for the same reason as \textit{document archived} event.

\textit{User added}, \textit{user updated} and \textit{user deleted} events are all qualified as an administrator need to manage company's user list.

\textit{User archived} event is qualified seeing that it is a requirement that the system still are able to report who had read a specific version. A deactivated user object will only contain user's name while the rest information are erased.
\todo[inline]{Anna: Fix alt det her user deleted/archived/removed stuff}

\textit{User reactivated} event is not qualified, if a company wishes to reemploy a worker then there must create a new user in the system.

\todo[inline]{Anna: Forklar bedre hvordan reactivated ikke er kvalificeret}

\textit{Supplier added}, \textit{supplier updated},  \textit{supplier deleted} and \textit{supplier approved} events are all qualified since suppliers need to be manage by an administrator whether they are approved or when to be reapproved.

\textit{Approval requested} event are qualified seeing that it is important part of the system definition that the system must support an approval process.

\textit{Approval denied (Version)} event is not qualified as Ipsen does not desire this functionality since approver himself will contact Ipsen directly and afterwards a new approval request is made and the previous approval request will be deleted. \textit{Approval deleted (Version)} event is therefore qualified.

\textit{Approval confirmed} event is not qualified since its purpose is the same as \textit{version approved} event.

\textit{Department added} and \textit{department deleted} events are qualified seeing that it is important for the administrator to keep track of company's current departments.

\textit{Department's documents updated} and \textit{department's users updated} events are qualified since it is vital to associate a user to a specific department and to associate documents to the relevant departments.

\textit{Department notified user} event is qualified seeing that the system must be able to send notifications to the correct user from a specific department that a associated document has released a new version.

\textit{Document printed} event is not qualified since the problem domain does not include controlling of printed documents.

Qualified events:

\section{Event table}\label{sec:EventTable}
The result of the selected qualified events and classes from \cref{sec:Classes,sec:Events} is an event table representing their relations, see \cref{fig:eventtable}.
The symbols used in the table is to be understood such that; $+$ is an event that can occur up to one time, and $\star$ is an event which can occur multiple times.
