\chapter{Design}\label{ch:design}
The aim of this chapter is to design the architecture components which will eventually guide the implementation of the system.

This chapter is divided into the following parts: Architecture Design, Application Method, and Component Design.
The Architecture Design in \cref{sec:architecturedesign} will introduce and discuss the criteria and the requirement priorities.
In the Application Method section, the main framework that the system will be implemented within is introduced and discussed.
In Component Design in \cref{sec:componentdesign}, the theory for component design will be introduced, followed by the project's architecture component design.
