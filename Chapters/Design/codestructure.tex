\section{Code Structure} \label{sec:codestructure}

In this section the design of the code structure will be introduced and elaborated.
This structure is created based on the anlaysis made in the problem domain and application domain in \cref{ch:ProblemDomain} and \ref{ch:ApplicationDomain}.
The design of the code structure can be seen in the figure below in \cref{fig:codestructure}.

The diagram represents the ideal classes to implement into the final product.
