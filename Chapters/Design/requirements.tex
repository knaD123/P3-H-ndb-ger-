\section{MoSCoW rules}

After the first draft of the system has been designed, it is important to prioritize the system requirements. This is because that there are no guarantees that all of the requirements and design ideas are doable within the time frame of the project, as there is a hard time limit set by Aalborg University. These priorities are set to determine which requirements are absolutely necessary for the system to function, and which requirements are simply nice to include. To make these priorities the MoSCoW rules have been chosen (literature). 

The MoSCoW rules classifies these priorities into Must have, which are the fundamental requirements to include of which the system wouldn’t function without. Should have are essential requirements to include if the time frame allowed, but the system could still function without. Could have are less important requirements than must have and should have and they would easily be excluded from the system. Want to have to won’t have this time around are requirements that can wait till a later point of the development of the system. (literature)
