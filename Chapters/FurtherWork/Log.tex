\section{System log}
Previously mentioned is the issue of administrators in effect being able to take over a users account, with no way to tell that this has happened.

In an ideal scenario, there would be an append-only system log, visible to all system administrators, into which any actions performed in the system would be appended.
Thus, if any malevolent changes to the systems were performed, such as a hostile takeover of an user account, the other administrators would be able to see this.
Or possibly, to extend the features even more, it could be possible to revert the entire system to a previous state, perhaps using a command pattern for changes to the application state.
