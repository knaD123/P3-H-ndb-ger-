\section{System interfacing with content}
Many features consisting of analyzing the contents of the uploaded PDF files were considered, but not implement. Among these can be mentioned.

\paragraph{Highlighting of changes}
As the documents uploaded were PDF's, detecting changes between the versions, and especially adding some sort of indication of them to the document, might have been difficult.
This was never explored, however.
\paragraph{Search text}
Using an utility like the linux software \texttt{pdftotext} to convert all uploaded PDF's into text, and then subsequently allowing the user to search documents and previous versions, could have been an useful feature to implement.
