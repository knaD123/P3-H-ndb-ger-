\section{More Iterations And Usability Tests}

Should the development of the system continue it is vital that more iterations and usability tests of the system, navigation, and interface are performed.

As written in the results from the fourth usability test in \cref{fourthtest} there were problems with the system interface.
There were, among other things, problems with the visual cues on the interface.
An example of this is that Ipsen had problems with identifying the right buttons to upload and download documents.
This was listed as a critical issue as it is important for administrators and writers to be able to manage the documents by uploading and downloading.

This is just one example of interface issues in relation to being intuitive.
To be able to perfect the interface and make it as intuitive as possible, more iterations and tests are required.
During these iterations it would be possible to think of new ways the information of the system could be relayed to the user, and give indication of how they should interact with it.
