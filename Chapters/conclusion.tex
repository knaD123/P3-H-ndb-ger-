\chapter{Conclusion}
%mirror introduction
The case of document management of handbooks has been analyzed and modeled in order to build a system fulfilling the requirements of the user, Pia Ipsen.
From the beginning it was a priority that the system should be easy to use and cheap.
Making the system usable has been central to the design process which came to show during the usability test.
There were multiple issues but by the last usability test the majority of them were cosmetic.
A company can set up the system on their own servers which should keep the cost reasonable.

%conclude on toc
The problem domain has been thoroughly analyzed in order to correctly represent it and the application domain as well in order to understand the user which enabled the design to reflect those findings.
The work flow supported this goal, as it allowed corrections based on later findings.
Testing has been more focused on making the system usable and less focused on making sure that it is reliable.
The system is not implemented to the full potential of the analysis but does provide a Minimum Viable Product.
It can however still be developed further both by fixing bugs, fulfilling the less important requirements that were not fulfilled this time around and further expanding the system.

%reflect on problemstatement
The analysis required to fulfill the problem statement is complete and while many things can be developed further the bare necessities are present.
