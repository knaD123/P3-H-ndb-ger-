\subsection{Use cases} \label{sec:usecases}
The main functionality that every actor needs is access to the current handbook. How they do so is described in \cref{tab:access-handbook} and shown in \cref{fig:access-handbook}.

There is a fork depending on whether it is the first time a user logs in because when a new user is created, they have a username, a name/ID and a standard password.
For security reasons this standard password needs to be changed as otherwise anyone could log into the system with only a username.
The first login is also an account activation through which the password is changed and an e-mail address and phone number may be added.

In early designs the user was activated through an e-mail address or phone number authentication.
However as seen in \cref{tab:actor-reader} not all of the system's users have a work related e-mail address or phone number.
As seen in Actor table not all of the users have a work related e-mail address or phone number.
Therefore it is not possible for the system to authenticate a user through an e-mail, which was the case in earlier designs.
Instead the workaround of a standard password was introduced.
When the administrator creates a user they set their name and username.
The user themself can always edit their username by going to setting which is modelled in.
The administrator can also set an e-mail and/or phone number.
However the administrator does not choose the password for the user and their is no other means through which the user can receive a password.
This means that there is a timeframe in which anyone could access the archive with only a username.
This workflow assumes that the user will activate their account immediately after getting it.

Worth noting. The administrator can change a user's name while the user themself can change their user name.

The only use case administrator cannot do.
