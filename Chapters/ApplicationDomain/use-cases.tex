A user can view the documents in a chapter by clicking unfold on that specific chapter.
Alternatively they can unfold all chapters by clicking unfold all.
When they click on a document a preview is shown if the file is a pdf.

If they create a new one the uploaded file becomes the first version of this document.
If they choose an existing one the uploaded file is added to the document as the newest version.
Depending on the system settings they may also be prompted to write a changelog for the new version.
In both cases they will be prompted to choose the people who should approve this addition to the handbook.

After clicking 'Send for Approval' the view returns to the front page and they now have the document in their relevant documents.
They have the option to delete it until it has been approved.
After it can only be archived by adding a new version.

Another way to add a new version to the document is from the preview of a specific document.
In this case they are not prompted for chapter, existing ID or title as those are already defined.
The rest of the flow is the same.

The reader can also elect to download the document to read it rather than read it in preview.
Should they do so the 'Read' button is also accesible from the front page.

\\
The \textit{administrator} can view a specific document in preview.
Here a button called 'Read Status' is available and by clicking it a pop-up appears.
In the popup everyone connected to the document who has read it and who should have read it is listed by name.
They exit the popup by clicking outside it or on the x.

\textbf{Manage departments}

They can click edit user and are redirected to a menu where all the users in the system are listed.
They can then tick them on and off to select which users are connected to the department.

Worth noting. The administrator can change a user's name while the user themself can change their user name.
