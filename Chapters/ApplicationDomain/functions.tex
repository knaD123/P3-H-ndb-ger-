\section{Functions}
When creating a system it is vital to get an overview of the functions and to determine the complexity of these functions. 
This is done by analysis of functions, in which the first step is to identify all functions. 
The result is a list of functions with a related complexity and type. 
The section is basede upon\citep[ch.~7]{Rod-Aalborg}

%Taniya: some word is missing in the first sentence 
To begin the analysis a look at the system definition and use cases is necessary as it creates a template of functions that are ready to be analysed. 
The next step is then to determine what type each function belong to, this means determining if it is an \textit{update, signal, read} or \textit{compute function}.
%Anna: Hvad er the characteristics ved de forskellige ovenfor 
The most present type of function present are of the update type. 
These are described in \citep[p.~140]{Rod-Aalborg}
%... the OOA\&D 
as "Update functions are activated by a problem-domain event and result in a change in the model's state."\citep[p.~140]{Rod-Aalborg}
%Anna er det en definition eller description

%Taniya: Måske tilføje en kort beskrivelse af update, signal, read or compute

The reason in this is in the nature of the system, as it primarily lies in management of users and documents. 
This also means that the complexity is mostly simple as the margin for error is rather small in these cases. 
%Anna: Hvilken slags fejl snakker vi om?

Only exceptions are "Manage documents", where the complexity is in the validation where overlapping of information is not allowed. 
Furthermore "Track differences between document versions" can be difficult as different file types can be used by the users.

The "Notify user" is of the type signal, a function type that responds to changes inside the system.

"Track differences between document versions" is of the type read as it retrieves information from each document and presents the differences to the user.

%Anna: Hvor kommer de her funktioner fra?
This is the resulting table of functions:

\begin{tabular}{lll}

\end{tabular}

\end{table}


% Taniya: mener manage documents ikke rigtig er en funktion i sig selv men  der findes flere funktioner som til sammen gør det muligt at manage documents?

% Taniya: Synes at table format skal være den samme som dem i Class and Events afsnit
