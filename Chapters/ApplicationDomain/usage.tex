\section{Usage}
\todo[inline]{Vejleders tidligere kommentar omkring Usage afsnit skal rettes til}

In this section the usage of the system will be analyzed.
Who uses and how they use the system will be explored systematically through analyzing who the actors are, and the use cases of the system.
Both will be analyzed with an abstraction level to be able to see the more broad uses of the system.
The actors consists of the different user groups who will be utilizing the system and the use cases will describe the different uses the system will potentially have.

The actors that have been identified within the case are \textit{consultant, secretary, manager, worker}, and \textit{document management software}.
It should be noted here that the sofware in this context refers to the software that is under development througout this project, see \cref{sec:CaseDescription}.
This will outline what responsibilities that the system will eventually have when it is deployed.
The use cases of the system have been identified to be \textit{manage documents, manage users, manage departments, manage suppliers, approve new documents, read status, update Table of Contents}, and \textit{track differences between document versions}.

An overview of the relationships between the actors and the use cases are shown through the table below.
Here it is outline which actors have which responsibilities in relation to the system.

%Anna: Snakker virkeligt om consulenter (ikkef ordi vi ikke godt kan) men hvorfor da det jo er meget forskelligt hvilke rettigheder en konsulent vil have?

Whenever a new document has been added the TOC is updated.
The system manages users with varying degrees of administrative rights of which there are 3 levels.


\subsection{Use cases}
%Anna: evt fjern "use case:" fra hvert punkt i denne subsection

\textbf{Manage documents}

It is desired that a handbook containing several documents and their versions is being managed by a software.
This includes a TOC from which users are able to have an overview of the documents.
There are active and inactive documents, where the active documents consists of the newest versions of the documents, and inactive ones are archived.

The system also provides the consultant or secretary with the option to write a changelog, where the user can write why there are changes to the document.

\textbf{Manage users}
It is the secretary and software's responsibility to manage users and their administrative rights.
The secretary updates the system by adding, editing or removing users, while the software stores the users and their data in a database.
There are three types of users with varying degrees of administrative rights.
The secretary who has administrative rights within the system keeps tracks of the users and suppliers with their respective administrative rights.
The secretary is able to create, edit, and archive users.
%Tidligere oppe står der: The secretary can remove users og til sidst står der archive users. Kan ikke huske hvad vi blev enige om det med at fjerne en bruger

The secretary is able to create, edit, and delete departments by adding or removing users from them.
A department is subscribed to one or more documents which are relevant to the users within the department.

The software is responsible for notifying the departments whenever a document has been updated.

\textbf{Manage suppliers}

Both the consultant and secretary are responsible of writing in the handbook and keep track of changes.
It is the consultant and secretary’s responsibility to write a changelog, if it is required within the firm, and highlight relevant differences between versions.

% Henrik: Er det ikke quality manager der er administrator?
% Henrik: Det er ihvertfald det indtryk jeg har fået igennem rapporten indtil videre
% Henrik: Der skal generelt henvises til tidligere tekst + er lidt forvirret mht "consultant"
