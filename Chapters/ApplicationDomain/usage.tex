\section{Usage}\label{sec:Usage}
In this section who uses and how they use the system will be explored systematically through analyzing who the actors are, and the use cases of the system.
The actors consist of the different user groups who will be utilizing the system and the use cases will describe the different uses the system will potentially have.

The actors that have been identified within the case are \textit{administrator, writer}, and \textit{reader}.
The use cases of the system have been identified to be \textit{Access current handbook, add new file to the system, approve new version or document, access archive, add user, edit user information, user management, mark document as read, view who has read a document}, and \textit{manage departments}.

An overview of the relationships between the actors and the use cases are shown in \cref{tab:ActorTable}.
Here it is outlined which actors have which responsibilities in relation to the system.
