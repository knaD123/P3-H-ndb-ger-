\section{Usage}

In this section the usage of the system will be analyzed. Who uses and how they use the system will be explored systematically through analyzing who the actors are, and the use cases of the system. 
Both will be analyzed with an abstraction level to be able to see the more broad uses of the system.
The actors consists of the different user groups who will be utilizing the system and the use cases will describe the different uses the system will potentially have.

The actors that have been identified within the case are \textit{consultant, secretary, manager, worker}, and \textit{document management software}. 
It should be noted here that the sofware in this context refers to the software that is under development througout this project. 
This will outline what responsibilities that the system will eventually have when it is deployed. 
The use cases of the system have been identified to be \textit{manage documents, manage users, manage departments, manage suppliers, approve new documents, read sttus, update Table of Contents}, and \textit{track differences between document versions}.

An overview of the relationships between the actors and the use cases are shown through the table below. Here it is outline which actors have which responsibilities in relation to the system.
