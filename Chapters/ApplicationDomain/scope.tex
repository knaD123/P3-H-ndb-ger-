\section{Scope of the application domain}

During the application domain analysis the context and the people of the overarching problem were analyzed and discussed through the PACT analysis in \cref{sec:PACT}.
Afterwards, the use cases for the future solution were explored through the use cases in \cref{sec:usecases}.
Finally, the functions were analyzed in \cref{sec:functions}.

All of the findings, based on the analysis, will be useful in the development of the system.
The findings from PACT will be especially useful when the system and the interface needs to be designed.
Here the findings of e.g. that the users may have varying degrees of technical skills, potential color blindnesses, or their varying work contexts will have an impact of the design choices.

The use cases and the functions will be especially useful during the practical development of the system.
Here, the uses cases and their statechart diagrams and functions will form the basis of the implementation.
