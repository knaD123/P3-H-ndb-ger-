A \textit{reader} or \textit{writer} is alerted to a new document they need to read through an email or sms notification.
They access the document by logging into the system and finding the document in their relevant documents.
Once they have the document open in preview, they can mark the document as read by clicking the 'Read' button.
The reader can also choose to download the document to read it rather than read it in preview.
Should they do so, the 'Read' button is also accesible from the front page.
A popup menu, stating that they have read and understood the content of the version, will pop up.
The reader then clicks 'Agree', the popup disappears and the read status has been saved.
