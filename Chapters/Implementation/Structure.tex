The role of the Models, Views, and Controllers are as in a traditional MVC model.
The Controllers folder consists of files such as \texttt{DocumentController.cs}, \texttt{VersionController.cs}, and so forth.
These have a series of view actions, which often result in some data being passed onto the views in the \texttt{Views} folder.
More of this will be covered in the next section.
