\section{Directory structure}
A selected view of the directory tree can be found in \cref{ch:dirtree}.

The project is divided up into \texttt{OBHandbooks} and \texttt{OBHandbooks.Tests}.
Besides these, there are a series of utility shell scripts in the root directory used to restore backups and check the syntax.

The role of the Models, Views, and Controllers are as in a traditional MVC model.
The Controllers folder consists of files such as \texttt{DocumentController.cs}, \texttt{VersionController.cs}, and so forth.
These have a series of action methods, which often result in some data being passed onto the views in the \texttt{Views} folder.
More of this will be covered in the next section.
