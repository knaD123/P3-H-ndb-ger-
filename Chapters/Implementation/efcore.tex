\subsection{Entity Framework Core}
Entity Framework Core is used to communicate with the database, which on it's own is not object-oriented.
For more information on EF Core see \cref{sec:efcore}.
\subsubsection{Postgresql}
Postgresql was chosen as the database for the project.
The decision was purely based on prior experience with setting up the database.
Postgresql is often better suited for more advanced applications, [CITATION NEEDED] but as this application mostly used CRUD operations with few to no complicated queries, this was hardly relevant.
