\section{Directory structure}
The project, in it's essence, is divided up into \texttt{OBHandbooks} and \texttt{OBHandbooks.Tests}. Besides these, there are a series of utility shell scripts in the root dir used to restore backups and check the syntax.

As can be seen, the project is split up into Views, Controllers, Models, Infrastructure, and Repositories.

The role of the Models, Views, and Controllers are as in a traditional MVC model. The Controllers folder consists of files such as \texttt{DocumentController.cs}, \texttt{VersionController.cs}, and so forth. These have a series of view actions, which often result in some data being passed onto the views in the \texttt{Views} folder.
