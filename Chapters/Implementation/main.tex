\chapter{Implementation}
This chapter will cover the implementation of the system.
Firstly the structure of the working directory will be introduced.
Afterwards specific code examples will be presented from the system with code snippets.
Here the practical implementation of the system design will be elaborated.
Lasty Docker will be introduced and explained as this technology was used in the development of the system.

\section{Directory structure}
The project is divided up into \texttt{OBHandbooks} and \texttt{OBHandbooks.Tests}.
Besides these, there are a series of utility shell scripts in the root dir used to restore backups and check the syntax.

The role of the Models, Views, and Controllers are as in a traditional MVC model. The Controllers folder consists of files such as \texttt{DocumentController.cs}, \texttt{VersionController.cs}, and so forth. These have a series of view actions, which often result in some data being passed onto the views in the \texttt{Views} folder.
