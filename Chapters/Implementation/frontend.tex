\section{Web Frontends}
The languages of UI on the web are HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and each of these three languages have their own respective roles.\cite{nixonweb}

HTML is the most important of the three.
It's a markup language that is used to describe the structure and much of the contents of a webpage.
\begin{lstlisting}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>HTML Example</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>This is a <b>webpage<b></p>
</body>
</html>
\end{lstlisting}
The different tags can contain child tags, which in turn can have their own tags.
This gives the webpage a tree structure.

Two important types of tags are the \texttt{<script>} and \texttt{<style>} tags.
These allow for embedding CSS and Javascript into the page.
The CSS allows for different kinds of styling, such as colouring and positioning of tags.
The Javascript then allows for running code on the page, which can interact with the contents of the page, play sounds, send requests in the background, and much more.\cite{nixonweb}
