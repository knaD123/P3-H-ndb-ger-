\section{Deployment}
The application was never deployed.
Deployment, and subsequent use, is a place where possible mistakes could be found.
It is difficult to make a usability test that accurately simulates every facet of using the application, and the usability tests that were developed invariable contained assumptions by the project group about how the application would be used that are wrong.

No evaluation of the performance was done, which means ideas about how performant the application was were based on development mode on variably powerful laptops.
When the project would be deployed, quite probably on a cheap Virtual Private Server (VPS), it would be hard to predict the subsequent performance.
The program was also never used with multiple users on the same server simultaneously, which is something which should hopefully happen.
