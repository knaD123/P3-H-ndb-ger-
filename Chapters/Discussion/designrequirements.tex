\section{Design Requirements}\label{sec:disdesignrequirements}
With the MoSCoW rules, mentioned in \cref{sec:requirements}, the functionalities were placed into different classes of priority.
In this section there will be a look into the requirements and their fulfilment in the system.

The current implementation fulfills the \textit{MVP}, which consists of the \textit{Must have} priority.
These consist of:
\input{Chapters/Design/musthave}

These requirements are meant as an elaboration upon the first requirement which is \textit{The system should manage versions of handbook documents}, see \cref{factor}.

In the \textit{Should have} portion most of the requirements have been fulfilled.

\input{Chapters/Design/shouldhave}

In relation to the \textit{Could have} requirements only two been fulfilled.
The requirements are as follows:

\input{Chapters/Design/couldhave}

The implemented requiremetns are the first one, sending notifications when a document has been updated, and the second-to-last requirement allowing for an approval system.

\textit{"Option to sort documents according to different attributes"} - this functionality that makes the program more user-friendly did not enter the system.

As for the overall implementation all of the \textit{Must have} and \textit{Should have} requirements has been implemented into the system.
As the MVP has been fulfilled and extra features are included the system can be considered a success according to the priorities being placed in the MoSCoW requirements.
