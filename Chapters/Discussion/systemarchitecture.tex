\section{System Architecture}
When choosing the system architecture, Model-View-Controller stood out as it functions well in web development, and is well supported in ASP.NET Core, but it was potentially possible to use a different system architecture with success.

A downside of applications that are not web based, lies in the distribution of the system and how the system is updated to the latest version.
This means the developer and the user have to use third party websites or personally meet to install said update.
This also means software problems would take longer time to patch, as developers have to meet the users or otherwise make contact another way.

On the other side of the spectrum, the Model-View-Controller pattern stood out, because of the ease of use, and optimal accessibility.
