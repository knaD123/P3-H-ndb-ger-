\section{Browser support}
In development Javascript was used for site functionality, more specifically JavaScript was used to make notifications in the program but although JavaScript allowed the site to do so, language support for the Internet Explorer browser is lacking.
Although the latest version of Internet Explorer was released several years ago, it was said that users have little IT experience in \cref{factorcriterion} which means it is very possible that they are actually using this browser.
This could have been solved by generating notifications using other tools or simply sending notification when opening the system, since this is what you are looking for notifications.
% Rasmus: Det lyder lidt som om vi siger at IE ikke har support for javascript
% Rasmus: Måske burde vi nævne vi ikke har testet det i IE, eller bare teste det i IE.

\section{AJAX}

Furhermore, in the system state right now, all text in a completed form will disappear if parts of the form are not validated.

This could be solved using Ajax, which is a development technique that can make a web application send and retrieve data from a server in the background, without interfering with and existing page.

If the forms were made to use client-side validation instead of traditional HTML forms, it could send the requests in the background using ajax, and not clear the form when wrong input was sent.

However, the problem was only discovered in the last iteration, so a lack of time was cause for it not to be resolved.
