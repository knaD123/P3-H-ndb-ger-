\section{Browser support}
In development Javascript was used for site functionality, more specifically JavaScript was used to make notifications in the program but although JavaScript allowed the site to do so, language support for the Internet Explorer browser is lacking.
Although the latest version of Internet Explorer was released several years ago, it was said that users have little IT experience in (SECTION) which means it is very possible that they are actually using this browser.
This could have been solved by generating notifications using other tools or simply sending notification when opening the system, since this is what you are looking for notifications.
% Rasmus: Det lyder lidt som om vi siger at IE ikke har support for javascript
% Rasmus: Måske burde vi nævne vi ikke har testet det i IE, eller bare teste det i IE.

\subsection{Ajax}

Furhermore, in the system state right now, all text in a completed form will disappear if something is wrong.
This could be solved using Ajax, which is a development technique that can store data in a completed form if errors occur on the page, this means it can update parts of a page without reloading a full page.
However, the problem was only discovered in the last iteration, so a lack of time was cause for it not to be resolved.
% Rasmus: Jeg er ikke helt sikker på hvad det her betyder igen.
