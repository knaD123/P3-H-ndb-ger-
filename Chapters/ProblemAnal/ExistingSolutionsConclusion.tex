\subsection{Evaluation}\label{sec:solutionsevaluation}
To compare the different systems the \cref{tab:Exsisting} is made to show which features are present in which system.
The features will be evaluated are those requested by Ipsen, \cref{sec:requirements}.

The features seen in \cref{tab:Exsisting} contains ideas that can be used in the project's context.
Looking at the table the questions asked in the introduction to this \cref{sec:existingsolutionsintro} can be answered.
Below, it will be evaluated what features, from the examined solutions, are useful to this project and why.

\textit{Managing different version of documents} is an especially useful feature to take into consideration.
This is essentially the feature that Ipsen needs for her workflow.

\textit{Table of contents} (TOC) and \textit{automatically updating the TOC} are also a good ideas to include.
TOC is important to include as this could ensure that Ipsen is able to have an overview of the documents.
Updating the TOC automatically is equally a good idea as this would help the overview as the documents and their versions get updated.

\textit{Including a changelog} is another useful idea as Ipsen has stated that, depending on the firm, a changelog between two different versions is preferred.
This is a feature provided by Google Drive and DropBox, in form of a file history, see \cref{sec:DropDrive}.
This changelog should state what specifically has changed between the previous version and the current.

\textit{Permissions levels} is likewise a good idea as an average employee at the firm would only have to read certain documents whereas Ipsen's work, among other things, entails to manage the handbook documents.
This is a feature provided by Blissbook, see \cref{sec:blissbook}.
Here the permission levels could ensure that the average employee is \textit{only} able to read documents while Ipsen would have full control of the management.

\textit{Highlighting differences} is potentially also a good idea in relation to the changelog as this could further ensure an overview of changes.
This is a feature provided by both Google Drive and DropBox, in form of file history, see \cref{sec:DropDrive}.
Here the specific differences of the new version would be highlighted in relation to the previous.

\textit{Online use} \& \textit{offline use} both seem useful with different advantages and disadvantages for both.
The offline use is a feature provided by D4Handbooks, see \cref{sec:d4handbooks}.
Online use could ensure that all the documents were synchronized across different computers.
Offline use does not rely on working internet and the users does not need to update the documents directly in the browser, as they do if they use BlissBook.
This also allows the users to use their preferred text editing software.
Whether online, offline, or both will be used will be determined at a later state in the development.

\textit{Digital signature} and \textit{notifications} are also seems like very useful features
This is a feature provided by BlissBook, see \cref{sec:blissbook}.
% Anja kan du skrive noget smukt her? :-)

As the identified features has been evaluated the useful ideas are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Managing different version of documents
	\item TOC
	\item Automatally updating the TOC
	\item Register when a document has been read
	\item Including a changelog
	\item Permission levels
	\item Highlighting differences
	\item Users retreive notifications when relevant documents are updated
\end{itemize}

These ideas will we considered during the development.
Some will be used in the problem domain analysis in \cref{ch:ProblemDomain} and eventually prioritized in \cref{sec:requirements}.
