\subsection{Summary}
To compare the different systems, the table below is made to show which features are present in what system.

The features they will be evaluated on, are the features requested by Ipsen.

\todo{Hvis vi allerede nu i tabellen vil have det med supplier frem, skal den del skrives frem helt fra starten af og diskuteres under hvert system i eksisterende systemer}

Looking at this table we can answer the questions asked in the beginnign of this section, \cref{chap:existing}.

\textbf{Which ideas lay the groundwork for the system?}

The overview that the table of contents gives, is placed in every system that we are looking at which shows how fundamental it is to be able to know the contents of the inventory you are working with.
More so all our existing solutions also contain a change log that further expands the overview of the system.

\textbf{Do the ideas seem useful? Why?}

This pattern indicates the usefulness of a easy to use with a good overview program, which gives users a much easier conversion from previous methods to newer systems.

\textbf{Will the ideas work in your context? Why?}

Yes, the ideas will help giving an edge when approaching the design of such system.

\textbf{Can the ideas be adapted to your system? How?}

Yes, the ideas that are apparent in the other solutions is a fundamental tool for such systems as such it will be adapted in consideration with Ipsens requirements of the system.
