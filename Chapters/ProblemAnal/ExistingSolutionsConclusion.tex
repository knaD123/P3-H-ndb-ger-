\subsection{Summary}
To compare the different systems the \cref{tab:Exsisting} below is made to show which features are present in which system.
The features will be evaluated are those requested by Ipsen, \cref{sec:requirements}.

Looking at this table we can answer the questions asked in the introduction to this \cref{chap:existing}.

\subsubsection*{Which ideas lay the groundwork for the system?}
%Anja: Der mangler tekst her

\subsubsection*{Do the ideas seem useful? Why?}

Blissbooks and D4Handbooks are both based on the idea that document management is tedious and could be done easier.
However, Blissbooks is angled more towards an HR-department while D4Handbooks is made specifically for QMS.
This is exactly the purpose for which Ipsen intends to use the system, and the exact reason behind the need for a new system, and in that sense the ideas are useful.
%Anna: Hvorfor exact reason beheind need for a new system?
Furthermore, while many of the functionalities both of these systems offer to facilitate the goal of making document management easier mirror Ipsen's requirements they are also lacking in features.
Both of them have implemented rich text editors to retain full control over the text entered. 
This also enables Blissbooks to accurately highlight differences between versions, a feature that Ipsen has requested.
%Anna: Vil evt gerne tilføje:
%"Though as mentioned in \cref{sec:1-simpleTime} the build in editor is in no way wanted by Ipsen.

Dropbox and Google Drive are both first and foremost cloud storage and secondly file sharing. 
While these are both features that Ipsen could benefit from they are not her primary concern and the actual document management would work same as it currently does.
The implementation of a binary diff that dropbox uses to track differences is however a good idea as there will be many similar files due to the different versions of a document and the fact that documents are stored indefinitely.

%Anna: Diskuterer vi det her, eller hvor afgrænser vi os væk fra det (jeg nævner det kort i iterationerne så vidt jeg husker)


\subsubsection*{Will the ideas work in your context? Why?}

Some of the ways that Blissbook and D4Handbooks have implemented the features could be useful, particularly the registration of read statuses and notifications.
The rich text editor serves its purpose in both of those systems, however, it would not work in this context.
Ipsen has a backlog of many handbooks that would need to be imported and has stated that this specific feature would only serve as a nuisance since they would need to learn how to write in a new program.

It is necessary to be able to use the files they already have.
This is one feature that especially dropbox does handle very well but as stated before it does not bring any interesting ideas in terms of document management.

\subsubsection*{Can the ideas be adapted to your system? How?}
%Anna mangler der ikke kommenterers noget med How?

The useful ones absolutely can, and should too.
