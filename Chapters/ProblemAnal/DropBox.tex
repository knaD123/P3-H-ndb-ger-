Dropbox is a file hosting service that allows the user to place files on remote servers using the desktop client or using the web interface through a browser.
The Dropbox client creates a folder on your PC, which is used to keep the files inside synchronized with the Dropbox servers. In the Dropbox online variation, the user has to manually upload a document from his PC to the Dropbox servers.

The system focus lies in synchronization and information exchange but Dropbox also stores a file history that makes it possible to restore data.
File change histories are saved for 30 days.
The system uses binary diff to determine the difference from one file to another, this means only the difference from each file is saved and saves space occupied by the files.\cite{DropboxDiff}

For collaboration on projects, the system can create “Shared” folders. In these folders the users "can control whether people can edit, comment, or only view your files" and simultaneously updates live for all parties involved.\cite{DropboxShared}

For premium users of Dropbox, a "Smart Sync" functionality is available, that shows the contents of files without downloading anything.\cite{DropboxSmartSync}
