\section{Case description} \label{sec:CaseDescription}

This project will be based on the case presented by Ipsen. 
Ipsen is a senior consultant for the firm QMS consult where they among other things help companies certified management systems which among other things require document management in the form of handbooks.
In her work she helps these companies with their handbooks and in a few cases acts as the companys quality manager.

The handbooks consist of several documents that each describe procedures or guidelines for different aspects of a firm and its workings.
There exists several versions of each document where only the newest version is active, and all of the previous versions are required to be archived for at least three to five years. 
In reality previous versions are seldomly ever deleted due to the hassle of selecting the files no longer needed and the relatively small space required to store them.
A new version of a document must be written at least once a year, and before it is active it must be approved by usually one to two persons.
Each document has a title with an ID that can only be associated with that specific title. 
When a title has been paired with an ID, the ID can no longer be associated with any other titles, even if the current title should be deleted.

Ipsen works together with secretaries who works in-house at the different firms.
The secretaries have the responsibility of mangaging the handbook documents and the everyday workers who work at the firm.
Whenever a new document has been updated it is imperative that the workers read and understand the documents relevant to them and do so immediately.
Not all documents are relevant for each worker, as the daily responsibilities of the workers can vary.

The problem with the current work procedure is that all the documents are stored manually in folders on a computer and Ipsen must archive older documents manually to separate archiving folders.
This manual work method takes time and it is complicated to keep track of the newest documents and their approval stages.

Ipsen requires a system that can manage the documents and their versions.
The system should furthermore be used to manage that the everyday workers have read the relevant documents. 

The next section describes which relevant standard or requirement that must be taken to account regarding handbook management.
