When developing a new system it is important to explore existing systems.
This is to ensure that the designers and developers know which solutions already exist and thereby how the future solution is going to fit into the technological landscape.
To get inspiration for the development project discussed in this report some existing solutions that specialize in handbook management were examined.
After the exisiting solutions has been explored they will be evaluated systematically in relation to the features and ideas found in each of them.

The existing solutions covered are; \textit{BlissBook} and \textit{D4Handbooks}, as well as a short mention of the more everyday document management systems \textit{Google Drive} and \textit{Dropbox}.
All the systems were tried, besides \textit{D4Handbooks}, which did not have a publicly available trial version.

Many of the solutions introduced are Software as a Service (SaaS).
This refers to software which is not downloaded and run on the users computer, as traditional software, but rather runs in the browser, with much of the backend work happening on the owner of the softwares server \cite{saas}.

The systems will be analyzed and judged in relation to Ipsen's needs introduced in \cref{sec:CaseDescription}.
