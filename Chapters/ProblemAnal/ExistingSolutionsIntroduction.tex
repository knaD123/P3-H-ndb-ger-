When creating a new system it can be a good idea to explore already existing systems. There are a few questions that is worth asking when exploring an already existing system:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Which ideas lay the groundwork for the system?
  \item Do the ideas seem useful? Why?
  \item Will the ideas work in your context? Why?
  \item Can the ideas be adapted to your system? How?
\end{itemize}

In this project we will explore a couple of existing systems that specializes in handbook-management, \textit{BlissBook} and \textit{D4Handbooks}. We will also be looking at a more general version control system, \textit{Git}.
