\section{Summary}
In this chapter, it has been introduced what standards are and why companies might use them, see \cref{sec:standards}.
There has also been given a more in-dept introduction to ISO and, more specific, ISO 9001, see \cref{sec:ISOstandards} and \cref{sec:DMR}.
Looking at \ref{chap:existing} we know which approach other developers took when making similar products.
The general requirements specified in \cref{sec:DMR} will be used in \cref{sec:factorcriteria} and \cref{sec:requirementsdefinition} to specify the system's requirements.
