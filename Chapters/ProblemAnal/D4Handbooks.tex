\subsection{D4Handbooks}
D4Handbooks, developed by D4InfoNet, allows you to create digital handbooks that are similar to physical ring binders.
This chapter is based upon information from D4Handbooks's site \cite{D4Hanbook}.

D4Handbooks makes it possible to target documents to specific employees and to register whether employees have read those documents.
When a document has been updated the employees, to whom that document is relevant, will get a notification about the update.

These features are both very useful because:

\begin{itemize}
        \item
        The employees do not have to search the handbook for the information that is relevant to them.
        \item
        When employees are immediately notified of changes it is easier for them to make sure they are working with the current version.
\end{itemize}

The handbooks are stored on D4Handbooks' servers and it therefore requires internet access every time the users of D4Handbooks want to update their handbook or an employee wants to read information that is relevant to them.
D4Handbooks also provides a feature that allows for offline use. It is something that the user would have to pay extra for.

Offline management also seems like a very useful feature because this allows users to manage handbooks without having to be connected to D4Handbooks server.

Another feature that the system has is that there is an extensive log of all activities done on the system.
