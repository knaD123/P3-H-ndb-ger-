\subsection{D4Handbooks}
This chapter is based on information from \url{https://www.d4infonet.com/products/handbooks/}.

D4Handbooks, developed by D4InfoNet, allows you to create digital handbooks that are similar to physical ring binders.\\
D4Handbooks makes it possible to target documents to specific employees and to register that the employees have read the documents relevant to them. When a document has been updated the employees, this document is relevant to, will get a notification about the update.

The handbooks are stored on D4Handbooks servers and it therefore requires internet access every time the users of D4Handbooks want to update their handbook or an employee wants to read information that is relevant to him/her.\\
D4Handbooks also provides a feature that allows for offline use. This seems like a very useful feature but it is something that the user would have to pay extra for.

Allowing the users of this system to target documents to specific employees and to register that the employees have read those documents are both very useful features because: a) the employees do not have to search the handbook for the information that is relevant to them, and b) \textbf{*pga ISO*}. Allowing the users to manage their handbook(s) offline also seems like a very useful feature because this allows them to manage the handbook(s) wherever they are, i.e. in the bus or train.
