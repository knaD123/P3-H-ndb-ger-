\section{Problem Statement} \label{problemstatement}
Throughout this chapter the case and the consequent analysis has been explored.
The case presented by Ipsen is the main problem that the project works to solve through the design and development of a system that supports the management and versioning of handbook documents.
The following exploration of existing solutions outlines the current technological landscape in relation to handbook management which could potentially give inspiration to design of the future system and help differentiate it.

The existings solutions that were explored were Blissbook, D4Handbooks, Google Drive and Dropbox.
Here various features and ideas were discovered and will be considered in the further analysis and system development.
There also occured especially useful ideas such as \textit{managing different versions of documents} and \textit{different permission levels} (see \cref{sec:solutionsevaluation}).
These will definitely be included in the development of the system.

By the end of the chapter an in-depth analysis of Ipsen's first two interviews were made through rich pictures and the FACTOR criterion.

This problem analysis has lead to the following problem statement:

\begin{center}
\textit{How can a document version management software be designed and developed to support a firm's administration of their handbook documents so it is easily manageable by the administrators, and also accessible for readers and writers?}
\end{center}

The rest of the project as well as  the system developed as a part of it will seek to answer this statement.
There are several aspects of the statement to consider during the process.
These are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item
		\textit{Document version management:}
		The software must be able to manage documents and their versions.
	\item
		\textit{Design and development:}
		There are two main processes that the project group must undergo through the project which are the design processes and the development of the system based on the design.
	\item
		\textit{Administrators, readers, and writers:}
		These are the different roles associated with the system that need to be considered both during the design and development process.
\end{itemize}
