\section{FACTOR criteria}

Based on the data gathering we can make a system definition which seeks to define what problem the system should solve. A system definition is “A concise description of a computerized system expressed in natural language” (Mathiassen et al., p. 24). This means that the system definition aims to describe what the system should do, but also in which context is should be used in, as the system is going to be “implemented both technically and socially” (Ibid., p. 23). The system is going to solve a problem that exists in a specific context, it is therefore important to understand this context.
To analyze both the context and the criterions for the system FACTOR is being utilized. The FACTOR criterion consists of six elements and can be used to help with the system definition development or describing an existing system (Ibid.). In this context FACTOR is being used for the former option, which is to help facilitate the system definition development. FACTOR stands for:

\begin{itemize}
\item “Functionality: The system functions that support the application-domain tasks.

\item Application domain: Those parts of an organization that administrate, monitor, or control a problem domain.

\item Conditions: The conditions under which the system will be developed and used.

\item Technology: Both the technology used to develop the system and the technology on which the system will run.

\item Objects: The main objects in the problem domain.

\item Responsibility: The system’s overall responsibility in relation to its context.” (Ibid., page 40)
\end{itemize}

Based on the interview described on page xx we have been able to fill out the FACTOR criterions. In the following an overview of the analysis will be presented. The FACTOR criterion analysis will be elaborated on page xx.

Functionality: Managing versions of handbook documents.

Application domain: Mainly secretaries and 3rd party consultants will administrate the system. All employees of the organization will have access to the system to read documents.

Conditions: The target group consists of small firms who needs a cheap 
solution. The users have little IT-experience.

Technology: The system is only needed on PC.

Objects: Handbook, Table Of Contents (TOC), documents, changelog, and user.

Responsibility: Management tool to keep track of document versions.
