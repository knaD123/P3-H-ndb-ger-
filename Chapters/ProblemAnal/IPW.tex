\subsection{IPW}
IPW advertise the fact that their system can be used "no matter your previous setup", a feature which the client has stressed is of great importance if the system should ever be put in use.

They offer their services in several different modules, of which the most interesting one is the IPW Polaris. 
Its features can be udvidet with several additional modules but the majority of the needed functionality is already available in this module.
This module is made specifically for quality assurance and to make handbooks in compliance with different legislations, including the ISO standards.

The system ticks several of the necessary boxes: It handles different file types, there is a strict version control, employees are shown relevant documents first, relevant employees get a notification when a document is updated, and a system for handling the approval process.
%do all of these work the way pia wants them to? idk???

It does also have several features which the client has not expressed any need for or dismissed as unnecessary. 
Among those are a way to clearly determine each empoyees' responsibility, the ability to uddellegere the responsibility for document vedligehold and access on mobile and tablet devices. 
An interesting feature is the ability to view relevant documents as flowcharts. 
A concern is a) how the frickity fuck does this even mean or work and b) whether this is unnecessary fluff, which would be of no value to the client.

As the need for a simple system has been repeatedly stressed all these features might be overdoing it.
The editing is also webbased a fact that suggests, it is not possible to take the book offline, a feature which the client labeled as nice but not necessary.

They do not have a module made specifically for approving a companys suppliers but it is possible that either the one described or one of their additional modules can be utilized for this purpose anyway.
