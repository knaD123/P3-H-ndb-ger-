In the following chapter the problem and information related to it will be presented.
To gather information about the case's problem interviews have been held with the project's stakeholder, Pia Ipsen, who will henceforth be referred to as Ipsen. 
During the course of this project she was interviewed five times: 
Twice to gain information on the problem domain (on September 20 and October 10),
once for short clarifying questions (September 28),
and twice in relation to the testing of the system (November 15 and December \textcolor{red}{???}).

The information gained from these interviews is used to briefly present the case in \cref{sec:CaseDescription}. 
Additional explanations of standards and their relation to the problem is found in \cref{sec:standards}.
Furthermore existing solutions will be presented and discussed, in \cref{chap:existing}, and their pros and cons in relation to this specific case are discussed.
Building on that the system definition is presented in \cref{ch:SystemDefinition}.
All of this will lead up to the problem statement which will guide the rest of the project.

The knowledge gained from the interviews will be further analysed in \cref{ch:ProblemDomain} and \cref{ch:ApplicationDomain}.
