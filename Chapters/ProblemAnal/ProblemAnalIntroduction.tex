In the following chapter the case and related information will be presented.
To gather information about the case, and its underlying problems, interviews have been held with the project's stakeholder, Pia Ipsen, who will henceforth be referred to as Ipsen.
During the course of this project Ipsen was interviewed five times:
Twice to mainly gain information on the problem domain,
%(on September 20 and October 10), Anna; vil mene denne information er ligegyldig for læseren og sammenhængen
once for clarifying a few questions,
%(September 28), Anna; vil mene denne information er ligegyldig for læseren og sammenhængen
and twice in relation to testing the system.
%(November 15 and December \textcolor{red}{???}). Anna; vil mene denne information er ligegyldig for læseren og sammenhængen
\todo[inline]{Reminder om at før vi afleverer tjekker vi lige antallet af interviews igen}

The information gained from these interviews is used in this chapter to briefly present the case in \cref{sec:CaseDescription}.
The chapter will additionally present standards and their relation to the case in \cref{sec:standards}.
Furthermore, existing solutions will discussed in \cref{chap:existing}.
%and their pros and cons in relation to this specific case are discussed.
Based upon this the system definition is presented in \cref{sec:SystemDefinition}.
Finally the chapter will end in a problem statement which guides the scope of the project.

%The knowledge gained from the interviews will be further analyzed in \cref{ch:ProblemDomain} and \cref{ch:ApplicationDomain}.
