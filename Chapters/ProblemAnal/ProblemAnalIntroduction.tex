In the following chapter the problem and information related to it will be presented.
To gather information about the case's problem interviews have been held with the project's stakeholder, Pia Ipsen, who will henceforth be referred to as Ipsen. 

The information gained from these interviews is used to briefly present the case in \cref{sec:CaseDescription}. 
Additional explanations of standards and their relation to the problem is found in \cref{sec:standards}.
Furthermore existing solutions will be presented and discussed, in \cref{chap:existing}, and their pros and cons in relation to this specific case are discussed.
All of this will lead up to the problem statement which will guide the rest of the project.

The system definition presented in  is based upon the information first presented in \cref{ch:SystemDefinition} this chapter and the knowledge gained from the interviews will be further analysed in \cref{ch:ProblemDomain} and \cref{ch:ApplicationDomain}.
