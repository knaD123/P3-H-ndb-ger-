In the following chapter the case and related information will be presented.
To gather information about the case, and its underlying problems, interviews have been held with the project's stakeholder, Pia Ipsen, who will henceforth be referred to as Ipsen.
During the course of this project Ipsen was interviewed five times:
Three times to mainly gain information on the problem domain where one was to clarify a few questions about the domain, and twice in relation to testing the implemented system.

The information gained from these interviews is used in this chapter to briefly present the case in \cref{sec:CaseDescription}.
The chapter will additionally present standards and their relation to the case in \cref{sec:standards}.
Furthermore, existing solutions will discussed in \cref{chap:existing}.
Based upon this, the system definition is presented in \cref{sec:SystemDefinition}.
Finally, the chapter will end in a problem statement which guides the scope of the project.

The knowledge gained from the interviews will be further analyzed in \cref{ch:ProblemDomain} and \cref{ch:ApplicationDomain}.
